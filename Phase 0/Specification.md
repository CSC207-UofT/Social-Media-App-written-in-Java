## Specification

Our application allows interaction between two or multiple different users. Each `User` needs to create an account first by choosing a valid `username` and `password` in order to log in and get access to the functionalities of the app. After the user gets logged in, the user can add existing users to his/her `friend list` or block a user by adding him/her into the `blocked list`, then the user can choose to `message` any users inside the friend list and block any messages coming from the user who is in the blocked list. Moreover, the user can **join a group chat** and **send** message to everyone that’s in this group chat, in which a group chat consists of three or more users. 

Our app has an additional feature where a user can create `posts` and **share** them to the sharing centre where all of his/her friends can `view`, `comment`, or `like`. The user will get a `notification` and be **notified** whenever his/her post is commented on or liked. A `sharing centre` of a particular user should contain all the posts shared by the user’s friends and the user itself. In addition, a user can decide who can view his/her posts in the sharing centre.
