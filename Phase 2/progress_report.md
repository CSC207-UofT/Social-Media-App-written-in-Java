## a summary of what each group member has been working on and plans to work on next

**Grace**: During phase 2, I extended and implemented the add friend, remove friend, log in, create an account feature, check friend features such that they can catch the potential errors from the user and have fail-safe measures. I also refactored the existing codes by using the dependency injection pattern and command design pattern. I also refactored the previous user controllers and presenters to follow clean architectures. In addition, Lastly, I added testings for all user controllers and presenters, and removed the code smell such as the long method.

This pull request exemplifies one of the features I implemented (add friend). Before modification, the user can add anyone including themselves or existing friends. I checked the possible failures and made accommodations.

This is one of my earlier pull requests where I implemented the log in feature and made the initial interface. This is important because this is the first shape of our program. In addition, I also showed that I use the clean architecture by separating controller with UI.


**Elizabeth**: I refactored serialization related classes such that data can be stored when running. To read and write data properly without violating clean architecture, I fixed read data and write data methods in UserManager. I also wrote tests for class User, UserManager, UserList and data access. Moreover, I add additional feature block list so that users can block people they do not want to add. For refactoring, I did many trivial changed to avoid code smells. I also added 2 design patterns (dependency injection and template method) to achive better code clarity as well as avoiding code smells.

This pull request added many classes related to blocked list feature, where I implement many layers so I think this shows what I learned during this project.

In this pull request I fixed problems that users cannot save their state while the program is running. I got a very good experience about how to implement serialization through pull request like this.


**Zhiqi Zhao**: I created presenters and defined Input Boundaries and Output Boundaries for tasks associated with person-to-person chat. I also implemented the function that saving chat histories in separate files so that we can review chat history after rerun the program. Also, i wrote tests for entity, usecase, controllers and presenters of person-to-person messaging. I refactored chat UI so that the two users can send messages to each other only if they are friends. I used Facade and Dependency Injection to refactor my code so that they follows Solid Principle and Clean Architecture. 
https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-alifafa/pull/27 This pull request shows i finished chat UI and implemented the function that our program can store person-to-person chat history , even rerun our program.

**Stephanie**:  I created the edit info feature so that users can edit their password if needed, this includes files such as controllers, presenters, out/input boundaries, UIs etc.I also added the log out feature that allows users to log out from an account. We created this feature so that users cannot login twice and will have to first log out if they're logged in. We also make sure that they cannot log out when they are not logged in. This includes files such as controllers, presenters, out/input boundaries, UIs etc, as shown partially in this pull request https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-alifafa/pull/122 . I also implemented the check friend feature so that we can check if two users are friends. This is largely used by other features, for example, we need to check friend before we can send a message to another person or before we can delete a friend. This is partially shown in this pull request, https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-alifafa/pull/97 . I also wrote some tests and a design pattern(null pattern) in phase 2. 

**Houyi Chen**: I created a Group entity and PtoG chat entity and every controller, managers, and UIs that belong to those two entities. In Phase 1, I have created two new functions that associate with ‘Group’, which are ‘Create Group’ and ‘JoinGroup’. In conclusion, the user can now use the command ‘create a group’ to create a new group with an unique ID; use ‘join group’ to join an existing group; use ‘group chat’ to send a message to a group. For future development, I plan to store all group chat history to a local file and also make it work with GUI.
In Phase 2, I finished creating ‘Create a group’ and ‘joinGroup’ so now they won’t return any error and accidentally terminate the program. Also, the biggest improvement is that both Group data and Group chat data can now be saved to a local file, which will allow the users to use those data whenever they need. I have also created a new feature which is the ‘kick group’ with all the layers and it can kick a member out of the group. As in https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-alifafa/pull/124 and also more test cases

**Lucas Lei**: I tried implementing the Andriod user interface, but both me and my teammates were having unexpected difficulties regarding some malicious errors (New errors invoked every time someone pull the branch). We basically wasted 2 weeks of time on it. Regardless, I have refactored a lot of the codes we wrote on Phase 1 that was found to be unhelpful or mistaken. As shown in https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-alifafa/commit/ffc76d54d2c4d9882023cbad1607cb6ca282dd3c . I implemented the command UIs, controllers, and presenters (including testings) for post and sharing center. Show in https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-alifafa/commit/aaf76a46d27d4e7c5163c080f1bfba914c8ba8a0. I have been involved in fixing and solving the errors and warning our code had. Making sure we have a clean code and zero warnings.

## What has worked well so far:
Right now, our code organization has strictly followed the clean Architecture, as well as SOLID. In short, our code organization is much better than in phase 0 and phase 1; and we have also created different test cases to test our entity, use case, controller, and presenter. Also, all the designed functions can be used right now, such as sharing centres, group chat etc. Posts and comments and sharing center and chat history can now be stored in a local file. Moreover, we successfully implement many design patterns that helped our designs.
